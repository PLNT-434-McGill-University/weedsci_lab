## Sprayer Calibration Introduction

calibrate (v.)â€”
to set an instrument so that readings taken from it are **absolute** rather than **relative**.

## Why bother calibrating?


To maximize pesticide value
To minimize crop injury
To insure use of legal label rates



## Important Terms






## 


A sprayer has 6 nozzles 
which are spaced 20 inches apart. 

What is the total boom width?



## Abbreviations

Abbreviations for dry formulations:






## Nozzles




## Nozzles





## Nozzles



## The Timed Flow Method

- Select nozzle type based on:  
  - Method of application  
  - Field conditions  
  - Pesticide product  
  - Sprayer pressure   

- Select nozzle tip (size) based on:  
  - Target gallons per minute (GPM)  
  - GPM based on: gpa, mph, nozzle spacing  



## If we know

- Rate we want to apply ($\frac{gallons}{acre}$, GPA)

- Speed that we want to drive the sprayer ($\frac{miles}{hour}$, MPH)

- Spacing between the nozzles (inches, width)

. . . 

Then how we calculate the gallons that need to be delivered by each nozzle per minute ($\frac{gallons}{minute}$, GPM)



## 


$$GPM = \frac{GPA * MPH * Width}{5960}$$
<br>

Where does the value 5940 come from?

[Practice Problem]{.blue}


A low pressure field sprayer is equipped with 16 nozzles spaced on 20-inch centers. The desired delivery volume is 10 GPA.  The sprayer is clocked at 5 MPH over a 300 foot calibration pass.




What is the boom delivery in gallons/min?




## Sprayer Calibration Calculations


Step 1. Find out GPM of each nozzle.


$$GPM = \frac{GPA * MPH * Width}{5960}$$

<br>

. . . 


$$GPM = \frac{10 * 5 * 20}{5960}$$

<br>

. . . 

$$GPM = 0.168$$


## Sprayer Calibration Calculations


Step 2. Find out the boom delivery ($\frac{Gallons}{Minutes}$).


$$Boom delivery = \frac{GPM}{Nozzle} * \frac{Nozzles}{Boom}$$


Boom delivery = 0.168 GPM/nozzle * 16 nozzles/boom



Boom delivery = 2.69 GPM/boom 




## Sprayer Calibration Calculations



What is the nozzle delivery in $\frac{oz}{minute}$?


$$\frac{0.168 gal}{minute} * \frac{128 oz}{gallon} * \frac{21.50}{minute}$$


What about in $\frac{mL}{minute}$ mL/min?

$$\frac{0.168 gal}{minute} * \frac{3785 mL}{gallon} * \frac{635.9 mL}{minute}$$



## Volume/Pressure Ratio

$$\frac{V_{1}}{V_{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{P_{1}}}{\sqrt{P_{2}}}$$

## 


You know that the TeeJet nozzle 8002VS delivers 0.2 GPM when pressure is at 40 PSI. If a grower needs a GPM of 0.18 using this same nozzle, what pressure should his/her system be at?  

<br>


$$\frac{V_{1}}{V_{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{P_{1}}}{\sqrt{P_{2}}}$$

<br>

. . . 

$$\frac{0.2}{0.18} = \frac{\sqrt{40}}{\sqrt{P_{2}}}$$

<br>

. . . 

$$P_{2} = 32.4$$
